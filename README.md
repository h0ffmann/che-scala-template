# Eclipse Che IDE 

A simple Scala "Hello World!" application, buildable with sbt. Useful for testing Eclipse Che Scala workspaces.


# Building manually

| Task  | Command             | Real command
| ----- | ------------------- | -------------
| Build | ~~`sbt compile` ~~  | ./sbt compile
| Run   | ~~`sbt run` ~~      | ./sbt run


# Problems

- [x] Init project not working
- [ ] Sbt shell not working
- [ ] Support for code dependecy navigation (even with .withSources() downloaded seems to not work properly)
